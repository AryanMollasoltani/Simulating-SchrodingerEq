# Simulating-SchrodingerEq
My final highschool project, simulating the 1D time independent schr√∂dinger equation.
You can specify the V(x) in the code, and it will create and display the energy levels and the respective eigenstates with the potential on the same graph.
You can also specify the length of the potential well. The unit is nm and the variable is "L".
